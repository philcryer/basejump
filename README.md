# basejump

Basejump uses [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com) to automate the setup of new hosts with applications, dotfiles, configs, and handly-dandy one-liners on Linux and macOS systems. I needed one command I could run to get the game going from scratch, so this script installs Ansible via Pip, then gets my preferred setups from my [philcryer/dotfiles](https://github.com/philcryer/dotfiles) project, and puts them in place so I have an identical setup on all of the hosts I work on. Easy peasy lemon squeezy.

Some of installed software (see full list for [Linux](/ansible/group_vars/linux.yml) and [macOS](/ansible/group_vars/darwin.yml#L15) and add/remove what you want)  

* networking tools: nc, iperf, nmap
* monitoring: htop
* applications: nginx, vlc
* development: [SpaceVim](https://spacevim.org/), font-hack-nerd-font, VS Code (macOS), iTerm 2 (macOS)

__NOTICE__ if you don't have Ansible installed, basejump will do that first via Pip, automatically!

## requirements

* Linux or macOS (10.12+)
* python
* pip
* git
* sudo

## usage

Checkout the code, change into the directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/philcryer/basejump.git
cd basejump
```

Edit `ansible/group_vars/all.yml` and set your git username and email variables

Look over what's going to be done by reading `ansible/tasks/main.yml`, then run `basejump`, which will automatically install Ansible if it's not already installed, via Pip, and then setup all of applications and dot files I can't live without

```
basejump
```

Do you want to just AUTORUN this *without prompts?* using one of those `curl` methods? I always say you shouldn't do this, it's a security risk, but look, I'm not your boss, and yolo, so why the hell not?

```
curl -s -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/philcryer/basejump/master/src/auto.sh -O; chmod 755 auto.sh; ./auto.sh
```

When it's done, close your terminal session, log back in and you should be all set. YMMV, Not responsible for lost or stolen articles, this offer not valid in Tennessee. Sorry Tennessee!

## issues

* Linux: if you're not running Debian/GNU Linux _(recommended)_ or Ubuntu Linux, reach out, I'd like this tested on more Linux distros.

* macOS: if you see errors about Vim not having Lua support you can fix it by installing a "better" vim than stock via `homebrew`:

```
brew install macvim --with-cscope --with-lua --override-system-vim
sudo brew linkapps
```
